## FactoryGirl

<hr/>
### Easy-to-use Fixture Tool
<hr/>

Though Skinny's FactoryGirl is not a complete port of [thoughtbot/factory_girl](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl), this module is quite useful when testing your apps.

FactoryGirl depends on only Skinny ORM. You can use FactoryGirl even in your Play2 apps!

```
libraryDependencies += "org.skinny-framework" %% "skinny-factory-girl" % "<%= @skinny1_version %>" % "test"
```

<hr/>
### Usage
<hr/>

FactoryGirl's usage is very simple.

- Defining `SkinnyCRUDMapper`
- Append definitions to `factories.conf`

#### Example code

```scala
import skinny.orm._

case class Company(id: Long, name: String)
object Company extends SkinnyCRUDMapper[Company] {
  def extract ...
}

case class Member ...
object Member extends SkinnyCRUDMapper[Member] ...

case class Country ...
object Country extends SkinnyCRUDMapper[Country] ...

import skinny.test._

val company1 = FactoryGirl(Company).create()

// will forcely replace name attribute
val company2 = FactoryGirl(Company).create('name -> "FactoryPal, Inc.")

val country = FactoryGirl(Country, 'countryyy).create()

// variables will replace "#{foo}" in factories.conf
val factory = FactoryGirl(Member).withVariables('countryId -> country.id)
val member = factory.create('companyId -> company1.id, 'createdAt -> DateTime.now)
```

In this example, `src/test/resources/factories.conf` is like this:

```
countryyy {
  name="Japan"
}
member {
  countryId="#{countryId}"
}
company {
  name="FactoryGirl, Inc."
}
name {
  first="Kazuhiro"
  last="Sera"
}
skill {
  name="Scala Programming"
}
```

<hr/>
### String interpolation is available

By default, values in factories.conf is in string interpolation mode.

```
member {
  luckyNumber="${scala.util.Random.nextInt(64)}"
  memberCode="xyz-${System.currentTimeMillis}"
}
```

You cannot embed complex Scala code or modules referenced from the test code. If you need to do so, use variables.


<hr/>
### Methods

You should be aware that FactoryGirl has the following two methods.

<hr/>
### withVariables

Attributes passed to this method will be used for replacing variables such as "#{userId}" in factories.conf.

#### factories.conf

```scala
member {
  name="Alice"
  countryId="#{cntId}"
}
```

#### FooSpec.scala

```scala
val countryId = FactoryGirl(Country).create().id
FactoryGirl(Member).withVariables('cntId -> countryId).create()

// will use name: Alice, countryId: 234
```

<hr/>
### withAttributes

These attributes will overwrite the values in factories.conf. 

#### factories.conf

```
member {
  name="Alice"
  country="USA"
}
```

#### SomeSpec.scala

```scala
FactoryGirl(Member).withAttributes('country -> "Japan").create()
// will use name: Alice, country: Japan

FactoryGirl(Member).create('country -> "Japan")
// do the same thing!
```
