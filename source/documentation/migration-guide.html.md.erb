## Migration Guide

### 2.0 Migration Guide for 1.3.x Users
<hr/>

https://github.com/skinny-framework/skinny-framework/releases/tag/2.0.0.RC3

<hr/>
#### Moving from Scalatra to Skinny Micro

The biggest change is moving from Scalatra to Skinny Micro. We recommend you checking the 2.0.0 blank project first.

If you're in trouble for replacing Scalatra with Skinny Micro, please post questsions on Google Group or stackoverflow.com.

- http://skinny-framework.org/documentation/micro.html
- https://github.com/skinny-framework/skinny-micro

The migration is not so hard but you may need to work on the following things:

- Replace `org.scalatra.servlet.ScalatraListener` with `skinny.micro.SkinnyListener` in src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml
- Rename src/main/scala/ScalatraBoostrap.scala to src/main/scala/Bootstrap.scala
- Replace `skinny.util.JSONStringOps` with `skinny.json4s.JSONStringOps`
- Replace all things that depend on `org.scalatra` package with new ones under `skinny.micro`
- Fix some compilation errors due to renaming or removing existing traits (not so many)

<hr/>
#### Use json4s 3.3.x 

Skinny Framework 2.0 is compatible with json4s 3.3.x. Be aware that 3.2.x series will be incompatible.


<hr/>
### 1.3 Migration Guide for 1.2.x Users
<hr/>

https://github.com/skinny-framework/skinny-framework/releases/tag/1.3.0

Deprecated joda-time methods in WrappedResultSet are removed. If you you're using `rs.dateTime(...)`, just rename it to `rs.jodaDateTime(...)`.

<hr/>
### 1.2 Migration Guide for 1.1.x Users
<hr/>

APIs are basically compatible. If you don't have some extensions that depend on `LocaleFeature`, `RequestScopeFeature` and `SkinnySessionFilter` methods, 
your app will work fine without changing your code.

Though we believe migration is not difficult, please tell us here if you find something wrong.

<hr/>
### 1.1 Migration Guide for 1.0.x Users
<hr/>

Skinny 1.1 APIs are basically compatible with Skinny 1.0 though the release includes basic dependencies' major upgrades. 
If your app depends on the dependencies directly (not via Skinny APIs), you may need to update your code.

- All the components run on Scala 2.11 or Scala 2.10 (Skinny 1.0: Scala 2.10)
- Web framework runs on Java 7 or higher (Skinny 1.0: Java 6 or higher) 
- Web framework is compatible with Servlet API 3.1 (Skinny 1.0: Servlet 3.0)
- Web framework depends on Scalatra 2.3 (Skinny 1.0: Scalatra 2.2)
- ORM depends on ScalikeJDBC 2.0 (Skinny 1.0: ScalikeJDBC 1.8)
- Migration command depends on Flyway 3.0 (Skinny 1.0: Flyway 2.3)
- Test support depends on ScalaTest 2.2 (Skinny 1.0: ScalaTest 1.9)

Though we believe migration is not difficult, please tell us here if you find something wrong.

Use "org.scalatest.Matchers" instead. Sorry to say this.

<hr/>
#### Renamed joda-time APIs due to JSR-310

`WrappedResultSet#dateTime`, `#localDate`, `#localTime` and `#localDateTime` are deprecated and `#jodaDateTime` and #jodaXXX are added.

<hr/>
#### skinny package's Scalate precompilation error

Since Scalate 1.7.0, Skinny's blank app project's settings fail to execute `package` command.

```
default_ssp.scala:7: $_scalate_$default_ssp is already defined as object $_scalate_$default_ssp
```

Remove scalateSettings if your build settings loads it twice.
